Stronger manager <> direct report relationships are incredibly valuable. When you’ve established a good rapport, be sure and use your 1:1s to go deep. When you don’t understand something that’s being shared, ask for more details. And if you find your direct report deflecting, make sure to address any misconceptions, or inaccuracies on the spot.
